1) All routers and switches are in factory default state.View the VLAN database on SW1 to verify no VLANs have been added 
2) View the default switchport status on the link from SW1 to SW2
3) Configure the links between switches as trunks 
4) Configure SW1 as VTP Server in the VTP domain Flackbox 
5) SW2 must not synchronize its VLAN database with SW1
6) SW3 must learn VLAN information from SW1.VLANs should not be edited on SW3
7) Add the Eng, Sales, and Native VLANs on all switches 
8) Verify the VLANs are in the database on each switch 
9) Configure the trunk links to use VLAN 199 as the native VLAN for better security 
10) Configure the switchports connected to the PCs with the correct VLAN configuration 
11) Verify the Eng1 PC has connectivity to Eng3
12) Verify Sales1 has connectivity to Sales 3
13) Configure interface FastEthernet0/0 on R1 as the default gateway for the Eng PCs
14) Configure interface FastEthernet0/1 on R1 as the default gateway for the Sales PCs
15)Configure SW2 to support inter-VLAN routing using R1 as the default gateway
16)Verify the Eng1 PC has connectivity to the VLAN 20 interface on R1
17)Verify the Eng1 PC has connectivity to Sales 1
18)Clean up: Shut down interface FastEthernet0/1 on R1 
19)Configure sub-interfaces on FastEthernet 0/0 on R1 as the default gateway for the Eng and Sales PCs
20)Configure SW2 to support inter-VLAN routing using R1 as the default gateway 
21)Verify the Eng1 PC has connectivity to the VLAN 20 interface on R1 
22)Verify the Eng1 PC has connectivity to Sales1
23)Clean up: Shut down interface FastEthernet0/0 on R1 
24)Enable layer 3 routing on SW2
