Host Setup
1)Configure the IP address and default gateway on PC1, PC2 and Ext_S1 as shown:
************
PPP with PAP Authentication
2)Configure the leased line from router NY-CPE1 to the service provider router SP1 according to the network topology diagram.
Interface Serial 3/0 is used on both sides of the link.
The service provider has instructed you to configure PPP with PAP authentication using the username NY1 and password iman
Configure one way authentication, do not authenticate the service provider. Configure a bandwidth of 128kbps.
3)Verify the interface is up.
4)Ping the service provider to verify connectivity.
5)Configure a default static route for Internet access over the leased line.
6)Ping the external server at 203.0.113.18 from NY-CPE1 to verify Internet access.
7)Do you expect PC1 to be able to ping the external server at 203.0.113.18? Why or why not? Verify this.
 ************
MultiLink PPP with CHAP Authentication
8)Configure a MultiLink PPP leased line from router BOS-CPE to the service provider router SP2 according to the network topology diagram.
Interfaces Serial 3/0 and 3/1 are used on both sides of the link.
The service provider has instructed you to configure PPP with two way CHAP authentication using the password Flackbox2. The service provider routerâ€™s hostname is SP2.
Configure a bandwidth of 256kbps.
9)Verify the interface is up.
10)Ping the service provider to verify connectivity.
11)Configure a default static route for Internet access over the leased line.
12)Ping the external server at 203.0.113.18 from NY-CPE2 to verify Internet access.
************
PPPoE
13)Configure PPPoE from router NY-CPE2 to the service provider router SP2 according to the network topology diagram.
Interface Ethernet 0/0 is used on both sides of the link.
The service provider has instructed you to configure PPP with CHAP authentication using the password Flackbox3.
Configure one way authentication, do not authenticate the service provider.
14)Verify the interface is up.
15)Ping the service provider to verify connectivity.
16)Configure a default static route for Internet access.
17)Ping the external server at 203.0.113.18 from NY-CPE2 to verify Internet access.
 ************
GRE
18)Configure a GRE tunnel between NY-CPE1 and BOS-CPE. Use IP addresses in the 192.168.0.0/30 subnet for the tunnel interfaces.

19)The tunnel interfaces will be up as long as the underlying physical interfaces are up. Verify the tunnel setup and connectivity by pinging the tunnel interface on BOS-CPE from NY-CPE1.

20)Do you expect PC1 in New York to be able to ping PC2 in Boston? Why or why not? Verify this.

21)Verify the tunnel interface appears in the routing tables on NY-CPE1 and BOS-CPE.

22)Enable single area OSPF on NY-CPE1 and BOS-CPE. Ensure that the PCs in New York site 1 and Boston have connectivity to each other. Do not enable OSPF on the Internet facing Ethernet 0/0 interface.

23)Ping PC2 from PC1 to verify connectivity through the GRE tunnel.
