Numbered Standard ACL
1) Verify that all PCs have connectivity to each other, to R1 and to R2
2) Configure and apply a numbered standard ACL on R1 which denies traffic from all hosts in the 10.0.2.0/24 subnet to R2
i. The PCs in the 10.0.1.0/24 and 10.0.2.0/24 subnets must maintain connectivity to each other 
ii. The PCs in the 10.0.1.0/24 subnet must maintain connectivity to R2
3) Test that traffic is secured exactly as required:
i. Verify PC1 and PC2 can ping R2
ii. PC3 cannot ping R2
iii. PC3 can ping PC1 and PC2

**********
Numbered Extended ACL
1) Configure and apply a numbered extended ACL on R1 which permits Telnet access from PC1 to R2
i. Telnet to R2 must be denied for all other PCs in the network 
ii. Do not change the existing ACL 
iii. Telnet access has already been enabled on R2. The password is 'Flackbox'
2) Test that traffic is secured exactly as required 
R2 telnet information --> USERNAME : iman ,PASSWORD : iman , PORT: 23
ii. Type 'exit' to leave the Telnet:
a. Verify that PC1 can ping and Telnet to R2
b. PC2 can ping R2 but not Telnet to it 
c. PC3 cannot ping or Telnet to R2
d. The PCs can all ping each other 
3) How many Telnet packets were permitted by the ACL?

Named Extended ACL
1) Remove the numbered extended ACL you just configured from the interface 
i. Do not delete the ACL 
2) Configure and apply a named extended ACL on R1 as follows:
i. Permit Telnet from PC1 to R2. Telnet to R2 must be denied for all other PCs in the network 
ii. Permit ping from PC2 to R2. Ping to R2 must be denied for all other PCs in the network 
iii. All other connectivity must be maintained 
3) Test that traffic is secured exactly as required:
i. Verify that PC1 cannot ping R2 but can Telnet to it
ii. PC2 can ping R2 but cannot Telnet to it 
iii. PC3 cannot ping or Telnet to R2
iv. The PCs can all ping each other
