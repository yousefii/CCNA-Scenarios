Connected and local Routes:
1- Configure the PCs with an IP address and default gateway  according to the lab topology diagram.
2- Configure IP addresses on R1 according to the Lab topology diagram.
3- Verify routes have been automatically added for the connected and local networks
4- Should you be able to ping from PC1 to PC2? verify this.
5- Verify the traffic path from PC1 to PC2.
6- Should you be able to ping from PC1 to PC3?verify this.

Static Routes:
7- Configure IP addresses on R2, R3 and R4 according to the Lab topology diagram.
    Do not configure the internet Ethernret 3/0 interface on R4.DO not configure R5.
8- Configure static routes on R1, R2, R3, and R4 to allow connectivity between all their subnets.
    Use /24 perfixes for each network.
9- Verify connectivity between PC1, PC2 and PC3.
10- Verify the path traffic takes from PC1 to PC3.

Summary Routes:
11- Remove all the static routes on R1.
12- Verify that PC1 loses connectivity to PC3.
13- Restore connectivity to all subnets with a single command on R.
14- Verify the routing table on R1 does not contain /24 routes to remote subnets.
15- Ensure that connectivity restored between PC1 and PC3.

Longest Prefix Match:
16- Configure IP addresses on R5 according to the LAB topology diagram.
17- Do not add any additional routes. Does PC1 have reachability to the Ethernet interface on R5? If so which path will the traffic take?
18- Ensure reachability over the shortest possible path from R5 to all directly connected networks on R1. Achieve this with a single command.
19- Verify the path traffic takes from PC1 to the Ethernet interface in R5.
20- Verify the path the return traffic take from R5 to PC1.
21- Ensure that traffic between PC1 and the Ethernet interface in R5 tale the most direct path in both directions.
22- Verify that traffic between PC1 and Ethernet interface on R5 takes the most direct path in both direction.

Default Route and Load Balancing:
23- Configure an IP address on the Internet Interface on R4 according to the LAB topology diagram.
24- Ensure that all PCs have a route out to the internet through the Internet service Provider connection on R4.
25-Traffic between PC1 and the Internet should be load balanced over R2 and R5.
